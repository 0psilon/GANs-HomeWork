## Bayes Generation - HW_1

The avatars:

The task was to develop an algorithm that would choose each pixel's RGB-values with probabilities we had previously counted on the set of avatar pictures. The result of the algorithm:

Since the algorithm doesn't take into account that neigbouring pixels suppose to correlate and actually depend on each other, the resulting avatar looks in a certain way, proving that this particular type of generation isn't the best option for picture generation.
